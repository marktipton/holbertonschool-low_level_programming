# Introduction to C Programming Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives

### General

- **Arithmetic Operators**
  - Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
  - Usage: Perform basic arithmetic operations on variables and constants.

- **Logical Operators (Boolean Operators)**
  - Operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
  - Usage: Combine conditions to form complex logical expressions.

- **Relational Operators**
  - Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
  - Usage: Compare values and produce a result of true or false.

- **TRUE and FALSE in C**
  - TRUE: Non-zero value
  - FALSE: Zero value (0)

- **Boolean Operators**
  - Operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
  - Usage: Combine relational expressions to evaluate conditions.

- **Conditional Statements**
  - **`if` Statement**: Execute a block of code if a condition is true.
  - **`if ... else` Statement**: Execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block if it is false.

- **Comments**
  - Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

- **Variable Declaration and Initialization**
  - Declare variables of types: `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`.

- **Assigning Values to Variables**
  - Use the assignment operator (`=`) to assign values to variables.

- **Printing Variables with `printf`**
  - Print values of variables using `printf` with format specifiers (`%c`, `%d`, `%u`).

- **`while` Loop**
  - Execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

- **Using Variables with `while` Loop**
  - Update variables inside the `while` loop to control loop behavior.

- **ASCII Character Set**
  - Standard character encoding scheme with numeric codes representing characters.

- **GCC Flags `-m32` and `-m64`**
  - `-m32`: Compile for 32-bit architecture
  - `-m64`: Compile for 64-bit architecture

## Common Commands

- **`ascii`**: Display ASCII values and characters.
- **`gcc` Flags**:
  - `-m32`: Compile for 32-bit architecture.
  - `-m64`: Compile for 64-bit architecture.
